      <p>Apes are tailless primates, however they can commonly be confused with monkeys. One big difference between the two is that monkeys have tails, whereas Apes do not.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Did you know that there are two types of Apes? The first type is the Great Ape, and the second type is the Lesser Ape. There are 5 types of Great Ape. These are Gorillas, Orangutans, Bonobos, Chimpanzees and Humans. On the other hand, there is only one type of Lesser Ape. They are called Gibbons, and are classed as a Lesser Ape because they are so different to Great Apes, however they are still Apes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Two of the most endangered Great Apes are Mountain Gorillas and Orangutans.</p>
      <br>

      <p class="p_format_other">Here are 5 Fun Facts about Great Apes: </p>
      <br>

      <ul>
        <li class="p_format">1) Did you know that the tallest gorilla ever measured was most likely a mountain gorilla that was supposedly over 6'4" tall!</li>
        <li class="p_format">2) Did you know that some orangutans have been seen using tools. Some make a kind of 'glove' out of leaves so that they can pick up spiky foods, whilst others use sticks which they poke into trees to try and get insects out.</li>
        <li class="p_format">3) Did you know that we humans share about 98% of our DNA with gorillas and around 99% of our DNA with bonobos and chimpanzees!</li>
        <li class="p_format">4) Did you know that apes use both manual gestures and facial/vocal signals in order to communicate with each other. One study took two different species of ape (bonobos and chimpanzees) and found that 'homologous facial/vocal displays were used very similarly by both ape species'. This means that both types of ape used similar facial and vocal expressions to communicate!</li>
        <li class="p_format">5) Did you know that many think the worldâ€™s oldest chimpanzee ever recorded might be Little Mama, who was stimated to be between 78 and 84 when she died!</li>
