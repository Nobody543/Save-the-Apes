    <p>Here are some things that you can do to help save the apes:</p>
    <br>
    <p>   • Aviod Products made from unsustainable palm oil. Palm oil is often needlessly used in common household products. This has meant that companies have commited mass deforestation in order to create space for palm oil plantations. This has resulted in orangutans losing their homes. However, through buying sustainable palm oil, we can pressure companies to stop unethically sourcing their palm oil, and to start caring more about the creatures in out environment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>   • Go on a trek to see mountain gorillas. Whether it’s in Rwanda, Uganda or DR Congo, tourism is a big reason that governments have stopped people from using gorilla habitats for agriculture. In order to go gorilla trekking, you need to buy a permit. The profits that the governments earn from selling these permits means that they have found the land to be more useful when it is being used as a habitat for gorillas. This means that by going on one of these treks, you are supporting the gorillas by keeping their land useful to the government and so protected. On top of this, you get to have a fun and amazing experience that you’ll never forget!</p>
    <br>
    <p>   • Support charities such as WWF and Sumatran Orangutan Society. Through supporting these organisations, your money could go towards <a href='https://www.orangutans-sos.org/take-action/donate/'>'buying veterinary supplies to safely evacuate an orangutan in danger'</a> (a quote from the SOS Sumatran Society website) or <a href='https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-a-gorilla/'>'training rangers to detect and safely remove snares set for other animals, which can often severely injure or kill gorillas'</a>(a quote from the WWF website). Donations are another vital way that ape populations are kept high.</p>
