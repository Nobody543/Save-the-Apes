    <p>Here are some things that you can do to help save the apes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class='nli'><p>Aviod Products made from unsustainable palm oil. Palm oil is often needlessly used in common household products. This has meant that companies have commited mass deforestation in order to create space for palm oil plantations. This has resulted in orangutans losing their homes. However, through buying sustainable palm oil, we can pressure companies to stop unethically sourcing their palm oil, and to start caring more about the creatures in out environment.</p></li>
      <li class='nli'><p>Support charities such as WWF and Sumatran Orangutan Society. Through supporting these organisations, your money could go towards <p><a href='https://www.orangutans-sos.org/take-action/donate/'>'buying veterinary supplies to safely evacuate an orangutan in danger'</a><p> (a quote from the SOS Sumatran Society website) or </p><a href='https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-a-gorilla/'>'training rangers to detect and safely remove snares set for other animals, which can often severely injure or kill gorillas'</a><p> (a quote from the WWF website). Donations are another vital way that ape populations are kept high.</p></li>
