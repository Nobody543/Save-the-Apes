    <p>Here are two of the biggest dangers facing great apes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1) Palm oil. Using products that contain palm oil is fine, however many products contain unsustainable palm oil. Some companies commit deforestation on a huge scale in order to make room for (sometimes illegal) palm oil plantations. This has resulted in many orangutans losing their homes, and having nowhere to live. At times, orangutans are even killed by workers who see them as pests and disturbances, especially if the orangutan is living in a tree that they want to cut down or are trying to get food from the area.</p>
    <p>If you would like to learn more about how to spot whether a product contains palm oil, visit here. Alternatively, if you would like to see some examples of companies that only use sustainable palm oil/none at all in their products, visit here.</p>

      <p>2) Lack of tourism. Tourism is a big reason that governments have stopped people from using gorilla habitats for agriculture. In order to go gorilla trekking, you need to buy a permit. The profits that are earnt from selling these permits means that the land can be more useful when it is being used as a habitat for gorillas. This means that by going on one of these treks, you are supporting the gorillas by keeping their land useful to organisations, and so protected. As well as this, due to the fact that gorilla treks bring in lots of money for companies, more money is spent on protecting these animals from poachers. The issue surrounding this, is that if there are not enough tourists going on these gorillas treks, organisations may decide that it would be more protifable to use the land for something else e.g. agriculture. This would put the gorillas in danger of losing their natural habitat.</p>
