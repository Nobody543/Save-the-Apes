    <p>Here is a short summary of some of the things that you can do to help save the apes. However, if you would like to learn some more in-depth information, read on below.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li class='p_format'>• Avoid products made from sustainable palm oil. It is used in many household products and often, apes are harmed/their homes are destroyed in order to make room for the palm oil plantations.</li>
      <li class='p_format'>• Support charities that protect apes. Three charities that do this are: WWF, the Sumatran Orangutan Society & the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund</li>
      <li class='p_format'>• Even if you are a child and still in school, do what you can. For example, you could hold a cake sale or do a sponsored run, donating the profits to a charity helping to protect apes.</li>
      <li class='p_format'>• Support charities via Adopt an Animal. This can be a fun way to support a charity and help save the apes.</li>
      <li class='p_format'>• Go on a gorilla trek. These can be expensive, however, through doing one, not only will you be helping to save the lives of many gorillas, you will also have a once in a lifetime experience that you'll never forget!</li>
    </ul>

      <p>   • Aviod products made from unsustainable palm oil. Palm oil is often needlessly used in common household products. This has meant that companies have commited mass deforestation in order to create space for palm oil plantations. This has resulted in orangutans losing their homes. However, through buying sustainable palm oil, we can pressure companies to stop unethically sourcing their palm oil, and to start caring more about the creatures in out environment. In order to find out if a company uses sustainable palm oil, there are three things that you can do:</p>
      <p>1) If a company only uses sustainable palm oil, they will often have information regarding this on their website. If you are not quite certain, or it doesn't say, try method 2.</p>
      <p>2) Look for the RSPO label on products. The RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) is a 'not-for-profit that unites stakeholders from the 7 sectors of the palm oil industry [...] to develop and implement global standards for sustainable palm oil'. If a product has an RSPO label, it most likely uses sustainable palm oil.</p>    
      <p>3) If a product does not have the RSPO label on it, you can use their website Membership search to check if a company is a member.
      <p>If a product does not have any information regarding palm oil usage on their website, does hot have the RSPO label, and isn't an RSPO member, you may want to consider using another, more palm oil friendly product, as it is possible that this product uses unsustainable palm oil.</p>
      <br>
