    <p>Did you know that there are 3 species of orangutan. On the IUCN Red List, all 3 of these species are classed as Critically Endangered, and have a population trend of decreasing.</p>
    <p>Taking bornean orangutans, for example, one model estimates that if the population decline continues as it was, by 2025, the orangutan population will be at '47,000 individuals'. This is less than 1/5 of the estimated population in 1973: '288,500 individuals'.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Mountain Gorilla is a subspecies of Eastern Gorilla, and, like the orangutans mentioned above, the Eastern Gorilla is classed as  endangered on the IUCN Red List. Whilst the eastern gorilla population is uncertain, the number of mature eastern gorillas is quite possibly below 5000, with one reliable estimate putting the figure at 2600!</p>

    <p>The horrifying statistics given above show how in need of help these great apes are. It is urgent and neccessary for as many people as possible to start helping to save the apes, before it is too late, and damage is done that cannot be reversed. Change is possible, as seen by species in the past that have been brought back from near extinction, and now thrive in the modern world. However, this is not done easily, and it is incredibly important that as many people as possible start to help. For more information on two of the biggest dangers facing great apes, read on below. Or, if you have decided to help the cause, and save the apes, visit our <a href="howToHelp.html">What you can Do page</a>, for tips and information on how you can help make a difference today.</p>

    <p>1) Palm oil. Using products that contain palm oil is fine, however many products contain unsustainable palm oil. Some companies commit deforestation on a huge scale in order to make room for (sometimes illegal) palm oil plantations, like the ones seen below. This has resulted in many orangutans losing their homes, and having nowhere to live. There have even been reports of orangutans being killed for damaging crops when they enter agricultural areas.</p>
    <p>If you would like to learn more about how to spot whether a product contains palm oil, or maybe would like to see some examples of companies that only use sustainable palm oil/none at all in their products, visit the <a href='howToHelp.html'>What you can Do</a> page.</p>

      <p>2) Lack of tourism. The money earnt from tourism and the permits required to go on gorilla treks has helped to create jobs for the local communities, and fund the staff that work to protect gorillas, with reports of former poachers now even becoming their guardians and protecting them! As well as this, due to the fact that gorilla treks bring in money for companies, they will probably be much less likely to sell off the gorilla habitat for agricultural development. The issue surrounding this, is that if there are not enough tourists going on these gorillas treks, organisations may decide that it would be more protifable to use the land for something else e.g. agriculture. This would put the gorillas in danger of losing their natural habitat.</p>
