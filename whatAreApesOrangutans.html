    <p>Orangutans are one of the five kinds of Great Ape. Bornean and Sumatran Orangutans are two of the orangutans that we know most about, however, they are both critically endangered.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here is a fact file on Bornean Orangutans:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Scientific Name: Pongo Pygmaeus</p>
    <p>Height: 3.3-4.6 ft.</p>
    <p>Weight: Most are 66-200 lbs</p>
    <p>Habitat: Tropical, lowland and swampy rainforests in Borneo</p>
    <p>Population: In 2003, the highest estimate for the number of orangutans was 104, 700. This number has most likely declined by a significant amount since this time. One research study projected that by 2025, this would have declined to 47,000.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Did you know that Orangutans usually only give birth once every 8 years.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Here is a fact file on Sumatran Orangutans:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Scientific Name: Pongo Abelii</p>
    <p>Size: 3-5 ft.</p>
    <p>Weight: 66-198 lbs</p>
    <p>Habitat: Tropical and subtropical, moist broadleaf forests</p>
    <p>Population: In 2004, it was estimated that there were around 7000 Sumatran orangutans left. It is now estimated that there are around 14, 500.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Did you know that in Malaysian and Indonesian languages, ‘orang utan’ literally means ‘person of the forest’!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Bornean and Sumatran Orangutans are only found in Borneo and Sumatra. These are both Southeast Asian Islands and their locations can be seen on the map below:</p>
